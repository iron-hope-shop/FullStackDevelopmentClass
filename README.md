# CS 470 Final Reflection
Brad J. | 06/30/2024

## Professional Impact

This CS 470 course has definitely pushed my skills as a full-stack developer. I've gotten hands-on with technologies that are actually used in the industry:

- Containerization with Docker and Docker Compose
- Cloud development using AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB)
- Building and testing RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express

These aren't just theoretical concepts - they're practical skills that companies are looking for right now.

## Key Takeaways

Beyond the tech stack, I've improved in areas that matter in real-world development:

1. Problem-solving: I can break down complex issues and find workable solutions, especially in cloud environments.
2. Adaptability: Tech changes fast, and now I can keep up.
3. Teamwork: Got better at collaborating using version control and communicating technical ideas clearly.

## Where I Fit In

With this skill set, I'm now equipped for roles like:

- Full-Stack Developer
- Cloud Engineer
- DevOps Engineer

I can handle both front-end and back-end tasks, work with cloud platforms, and understand how to streamline development processes.

## Looking Forward: Microservices and Serverless

Microservices and serverless architectures are big topics in the industry right now. Here's my take:

- They allow for more flexible, scalable applications
- Automatic scaling in serverless platforms can handle traffic spikes efficiently
- But they come with challenges like managing increased complexity and potential cold start issues

Cost-wise, serverless can be more predictable for variable workloads, while containers might be better for consistent usage patterns.

## Planning for Growth

When thinking about scaling up, there are trade-offs to consider:

Pros:
- Easy to scale resources based on actual demand
- Pay-for-use model can be cost-effective

Cons:
- Potential performance hits from cold starts in serverless
- Managing multiple microservices can get complicated

The flexibility of cloud services allows for aligning tech capabilities with business growth, which is crucial for planning expansion.

## Wrapping Up

This course has given me a solid foundation in modern web development practices. I feel prepared to contribute to real-world projects and continue learning as the field evolves.
